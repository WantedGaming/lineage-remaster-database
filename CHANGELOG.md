## Folder Purposes

### `/admin`
Contains all files related to the admin interface. This is where administrators can manage the website content, including adding, editing, and deleting items, monsters, and other game elements.

### `/assets`
Stores all static assets used by the website, organized into subdirectories:
- `/css`: Stylesheet files for frontend and admin interfaces
- `/js`: JavaScript files for frontend and admin interfaces
- `/images`: Image files for items, monsters, and UI elements
- `/icons`: Game icons for items, skills, etc.

### `/config`
Contains configuration files for the website, including database connection details, site settings, and constants.

### `/includes`
Houses reusable components and utility files:
- `/admin`: Admin-specific components like headers and footers
- `/templates`: Frontend templates for consistent layout
- `db.php`: Database connection and utility functions
- `functions.php`: General utility functions used throughout the site

### `/models`
Contains data models that handle database interactions for different entities (weapons, armor, monsters, etc.). Each model encapsulates the logic for CRUD operations on its respective entity.

### `/views`
Frontend view files that display content to users. Organized by section (weapons, armor, monsters, etc.).
